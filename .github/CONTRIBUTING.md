## Development Environment Setup

If you’d like to make modifications to the project locally, here’s how to get started:

1. **Clone the RAW repository:**

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/notmyfirstcodeo/rugby-always-wins.git
    $ cd rugby-always-wins
    ```

2. **Install dependencies and start the development server:**

    ```bash
    $ npm install && npm run dev
    ```

   This will start a local server so you can see your changes in real time. RAW is built with [Next.js](http://nextjs.org), so familiarity with it may help but isn't necessary!
